Overview:

In this assignment, I created a day and night experience where the user can witness a sunrise/sunset. The experience is controlled with three buttons. A panel with the three buttons appears in front of the user when they first loaded into the scene. The red button starts the sunrise that leads into a sundown. The sky, floor and mountains change in color as the sun moves. The green button adds clouds to the scene. The clouds move in the sky when the player clicks on a cloud. The yellow button removes the clouds from the scene.
I created this day and night experience because I am interested in creating immersive experiences over a game. I love watching sunrises and sunsets. I find the colors to be beautiful and serene. I think its really relaxing to watch so I wanted to somehow mimic that in this assignment.  

Challenging Aspects:

Some things I found challenging in this assignment was using JavaScript. I have not used JavaScript before this assignment, so I had to familiarize myself with the syntax. Once I played around with the code, I started to understand it better and with my programming knowledge I have learned over the last couple years, I was able to apply the logic I wanted with JavaScript. I also have not used HTML and CSS since first year and because I took a year off for co-op, I almost forgot everything.

Aspects that Went Well:

I was able to pick up the languages faster than I thought. I think Ali’s software design class helped a lot with my understanding in programming and I was glad I could apply that in this assignment. I used to struggle a lot with programming. When familiarizing myself with JavaScript, I googled most of it and looked at other A-frame project that people have posted. I also reached out to you, Anthony, when I had some issues and that was a great help! I feel a lot more comfortable HTML and JavaScript now.
Overall, I am pretty happy with how my project turned out as a first A-Frame assignment. I was worried I would struggle a lot with this, but it was not as bad as I thought. I feel like a learned some useful skills that I will definitely apply in future projects like the final assignment.
